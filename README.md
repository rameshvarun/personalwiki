_A Basic Wiki system for personal use._

# Goals
  - Let me create reasonably presentable documents simply by creating files in my Dropbox.
    - Has the extra side effect of easily allowing collaboration (though not real-time)
  - Interlink documents at the heading level, for Wikipedia-style referencing
  - A reasonable search system to quickly find documents
  - Be easily extensible to add any extra features that I would like
